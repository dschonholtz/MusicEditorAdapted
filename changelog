Created ModelAdapter class
Created Model interface to match otherView
Declared all methods used by otherView in Model
ModelAdapter HAS A Generic Song and IMPLEMENTS Model (I think this is correct design?)
Made getLowestNote and getHighestNote public in GenericSong, also added them to SongRep interface

Changed Note class to OurNote
Created Note class to match otherView
All methods otherView uses on notes are in the Note class now
Note had to be a class and not an interface because they use a static method from it.

Console controller now takes in a Model and uses a ConsoleViewImpl as a view.
Run now calls display on the model given

Controller factory changed to take in a Model instead of a SongRep

MidiViewImpl directly changes the model.  This is bad design but it works.
IMPORTANT NOTE: HAD TO CHANGE THEIR MIDIVIEWIMPL TO USE INSTRUMENT - 1 OR WE GOT OOB EXCEPTIONS IN DF-TTFAF.TXT
